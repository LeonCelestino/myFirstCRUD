# FIRST CRUD APPLICATION

This is a repository for my first CRUD application, it will be a simple survey project. Its objectives are:

    Develop my skills with React, NodeJS and MySQL
    The user, if wanted, can create a new option (since it is less or equal to 6 options),
    The user, if wanted, can edit each one of the options added (since the number of options are greater than 3 options),
    The user, if wanted, can delete each one of the options added (since the number of options are greater than 3 options),
    The user, if wanted, can delete the entire survey / post,
    Each post will have its creation datetime displayed in the post itself,
    Each post will also have its expire datetime. When it is reached, the vote buttons wanna be disabled,
    The creator's post can finish the survey by himself,

    There must be at least three or more options to be able to post the survey.

# WHAT FEATURES I HAVE DONE

Since I am starting to learn how to do a CRUD application, I am having some troubles, but I am learning a lot of things. By what I learned, till now, I was able to do:

    Feature to user can add a new option, since there is less than 6 options
    Feature to display post creation date,
    Feature to display the expire date, typed by user
    
    Send the data to backend, from backend, send the data to database
    From backend, take the data from database and post it in a post "API",
    Then I used it in my frontend, and displayed the data from it.
